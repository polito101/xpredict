# "Looks Done But Isn't" — Executed Audit (SC#2 / PLT-07)

**Phase:** 11 — Hardening & Operator-Demo Gate
**Plan:** 11-06 · **Date:** 2026-06-02 · **Branch:** `gsd/phase-11-hardening-operator-demo-gate`
**Gate purpose:** PITFALLS.md §"How to verify you haven't fallen into the trap" requires running the
entire "Looks Done But Isn't" checklist (`.planning/research/PITFALLS.md`, lines 447–478, **32 items**)
as a documented gate **before any operator demo**. This file is that executed gate: every one of the 32
items is recorded as `VERIFIED` / `CLOSED BY PHASE 11` (with concrete evidence) or `DEFERRED` (with a
reason + owner). No box is left blank.

**Scope (CONTEXT constraint 1 + 3 — non-negotiable):** This is a **verify-only documentation audit**.
NOTHING is implemented, fixed, or re-tested here. The wallet / ledger / concurrency rows are
`VERIFY-ONLY (Pol track)`: confirmed against **existing** tests/migrations and coordinated with Pol's
**separate** backend-test-isolation track (the PR #16 follow-up `DEF-03-01`,
`tests/wallet/test_concurrent_transfers.py::test_50_concurrent_overdraft` isolation debt). They are
**NEVER** re-implemented or re-fixed in this plan. `git diff --stat` for plan 11-06 shows
`docs/LOOKS-DONE-CHECKLIST.md` as the only changed file.

## Legend — Result / Class column

| Token | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `VERIFIED` | Invariant already holds on the consolidated F1–F10 base; concrete file/test/migration/commit evidence cited. |
| `CLOSED BY PHASE 11` | Closed (or its closure shipped) by a Phase 11 workstream — the dry-run (11-01), security-scan (11-02), Sentry runbook (11-03), or regulatory scaffold (11-04). Cites that deliverable. |
| `VERIFY-ONLY (Pol track)` | Wallet/ledger/concurrency item (CONTEXT constraint 3). Confirmed via existing tests/migrations; greening of the test-isolation residual is **Pol's separate track**, NOT re-implemented here. |
| `DEFERRED` | Genuinely out of scope for the v1 operator-demo gate. Carries an explicit **reason + owner**; surfaced at the Task-2 human checkpoint for Pol's go/no-go. |

## Audit table — one row per checklist item (32 rows)

| # | Item (PITFALLS.md "Looks Done But Isn't") | Class | Result | Evidence |
|---|--------------------------------------------|-------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **Wallet/Ledger:** SUM(ledger) == wallet.balance for every user, on every CI build with seed data | `VERIFY-ONLY (Pol track)` | VERIFIED (existing) | `reconcile_wallets` nightly Celery task sums `SUM(credit) − SUM(debit)` per account vs `accounts.balance`; clean→INFO, drift→CRITICAL + Sentry — `backend/app/wallet/reconcile.py` (plan 03-06, STATE decision 03-06 / SC#7 / PLT-09). Pol's track owns CI-on-seed greening. |
| 2 | **Wallet/Ledger:** `CHECK (balance >= 0)` exists as a DB constraint, not just app-level | `VERIFY-ONLY (Pol track)` | VERIFIED (existing) | `CHECK (balance >= 0)` (WAL-08) enforced and **DB-verified** (→ SQLSTATE 23514) in migration `backend/alembic/versions/0004_phase3_wallet_ledger.py`; STATE decision 03-01. DB-level, not app-level. |
| 3 | **Wallet/Ledger:** all money columns are `NUMERIC(p,s)`, not float/money | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | Phase 1 locks `NUMERIC(18,4)` via the `Money` SQLAlchemy alias (`Mapped[Money]`); enforced by the money-column AST lint (`backend/scripts/` money-lint, `backend/CONVENTIONS.md` §1, `tests/test_money_lint.py`) which runs in `backend-ci.yml`. STATE decisions 2026-05-25 + 03-01. |
| 4 | **Bet placement:** concurrent test (50 concurrent bets/user, insufficient balance for all) → no balance goes negative | `VERIFY-ONLY (Pol track)` | VERIFIED (existing) | 50-concurrent-overdraft → drift-0 / balance-exact / 25 succeed + 25 reject gate on production `WalletService` (FOR UPDATE inside one `session.begin()`, canonical UUID lock order) — `backend/tests/wallet/test_concurrent_transfers.py` (plan 03-02, STATE decision 03-02 / WAL-07 / SC#2). **NOTE (updated 2026-06-02):** the residual `test_50_concurrent_overdraft` test-**isolation** debt is now ✅ **RESOLVED** — `f8a8859` scoped its whole-table `SUM(credit-debit)` assertion to the test's own {genesis, wallet, counterparty} accounts (DEF-03-01's session-scoped poisoning was already fixed in `fae0d53`). Full `pytest tests/` is order-independent; backend-ci green on `main`. |
| 5 | **Bet placement:** bet + ledger in one transaction (kill DB mid-bet → nothing committed) | `VERIFY-ONLY (Pol track)` | VERIFIED (existing) | Atomic paired double-entry inside a single `session.begin()`; bet+ledger atomicity proven by `backend/tests/wallet/test_atomicity.py` + the bet path in `backend/app/bets/service.py` (Phase 5; WAL-07). Pol's track owns any isolation greening. |
| 6 | **Settlement:** run the same settlement twice → idempotent (no double payouts) | `VERIFY-ONLY (Pol track)` | VERIFIED (existing) | `SettlementService` idempotent settlement (unique ledger event scope, re-run = no double payout) — Phase 5 SC#6; reused unchanged in Phase 7 (STATE decision 2026-05-25). Reconciliation drift-0 is the standing sentinel (row 1). |
| 7 | **Settlement:** reversal path for overturned Polymarket + incorrect house resolutions | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | Reversal path writes compensating `reverse_*` ledger entries (netted in the KPI house-P&L formula — "reversal-nets-to-zero is the correctness sentinel") — `backend/app/settlement/service.py`, exercised by the KPI P&L seam (`backend/tests/admin/test_kpi.py`, STATE decision 10-02) and `backend/app/settlement/constants.py`. Phase 5 SC + Phase 6/7. |
| 8 | **Polymarket:** schema-validate all incoming responses; log unknown fields; don't silently accept | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | Phase 6 Gamma client schema-validates the stringified-JSON `outcomes`/`outcomePrices` quirk (spike-006 + Phase 6 SC); `backend/app/integrations/polymarket/`. (Phase 6 spike captured the Gamma value-space — STATE Blockers / PITFALLS #2+#9.) |
| 9 | **Polymarket:** settle only on confirmed `resolved`, NOT `closed: true` | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | Closed-vs-resolved guard — settlement fires only on confirmed resolved state, not `closed:true` — Phase 6 SC#7 (the architectural payoff of the `MarketSource` abstraction; STATE decision 2026-05-25). Polymarket resolution detection: `detect_polymarket_resolutions` (cited in `docs/runbooks/sentry-alerts.md` Rule 2). |
| 10 | **Polymarket:** rate-limit handling tested — synthetically 429 the client, verify backoff | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | Tenacity backoff on the Gamma client; Polymarket poll error path captured + alertable (`poll_failed` → `capture_exception`, `backend/app/integrations/polymarket/tasks.py`, see `docs/runbooks/sentry-alerts.md` Rule 2). Phase 6 integration tests + PITFALLS #9 prevention. |
| 11 | **Auth:** password reset invalidates all existing sessions (token_version bump) | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | Phase 2 auth — reset bumps `token_version` (instant session kill); recently re-hardened (reset-password RETURNING-rowcount fix, commit `eccd5c4`). ZAP baseline reaches `/auth/forgot-password` (`security-scan.yml` zap-baseline job + `.zap/rules.tsv`, plan 11-02). |
| 12 | **Auth:** logout actually revokes the refresh token in DB | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | Phase 2 refresh-token revocation in DB on logout (PITFALLS #8 prevention). `/auth/*` surface covered by the Phase-11 ZAP baseline (`security-scan.yml`, plan 11-02). |
| 13 | **Auth:** rate limit on login (100 wrong passwords → lockout) | `VERIFIED` / `CLOSED BY PHASE 11` | VERIFIED | `@limiter.limit("5/minute")` on `login_proxy` + per-email `check_email_limit` (5/min) → generic 429 on the 6th attempt — `backend/app/auth/router.py` + `backend/app/auth/rate_limit.py` + global `_rate_limit_exceeded_handler` in `backend/app/main.py`. Now also a Sentry alert (Rule 4 — auth-abuse 429 burst, `docs/runbooks/sentry-alerts.md`, plan 11-03). |
| 14 | **Auth:** email-enumeration — register + forgot-password return same response for existing/non-existing | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | Generic 429 / generic responses never reveal whether the email exists (T-02-08 / T-02-10), documented in `docs/runbooks/sentry-alerts.md` Rule 4 emit-site note; Phase 2 SC. ZAP baseline exercises `/auth/register` + `/auth/forgot-password` (plan 11-02). |
| 15 | **Audit log:** append-only at DB level (REVOKE UPDATE/DELETE; stored-proc inserts) | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | Phase 1 immutability: Postgres deny-trigger (`raise_ledger_immutable` / audit trigger) **AND** `REVOKE UPDATE, DELETE` — `backend/alembic/versions/0001_phase1_foundations.py`; proven by `backend/tests/core/test_audit_immutability.py`. Viewer is strictly read-only (GET-only `audit_admin_router`, mutations 405 — plan 08-02, T-08-07). STATE decisions 2026-05-26 + 08-02. |
| 16 | **Audit log:** every state-changing op has an audit event (grep for missing `audit_log.write`) | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | State-changers audited across surfaces: `wallet.recharge` (03-04), `admin.user_banned/unbanned` (Phase 8), `admin.branding_updated` (10-01), settlement, auth `session.started`. 19-entry `KNOWN_EVENT_TYPES` registry backs the audit-viewer dropdown (plan 08-02, D-13). STATE decisions 08-02 / 10-01. |
| 17 | **Admin resolution:** two-step confirm; resolution criteria locked at market creation | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | Two-step confirm resolution flow + resolution criteria locked at creation and visible on market detail (Phase 6 SC#6 / Phase 9 market-detail "always-visible Resolution criteria", STATE decision 09-04). Admin-side: `backend/app/admin/service.py` + `backend/tests/settlement/test_force_settle.py`. |
| 18 | **Admin actions:** every admin endpoint requires `is_admin` AND logs to audit | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | All admin endpoints are `current_active_admin`-gated (negative-tested in `backend/tests/admin/test_auth_negative.py`) and emit audit events (row 16). E.g. recharge, ban/unban, branding, export, KPIs. STATE decisions 03-04 / 08-01 / 08-02 / 10-01 / 10-02. |
| 19 | **Self-bet ban:** admin cannot bet on a market they created (DB constraint/trigger, not just UI) | `VERIFIED` (by architecture) | VERIFIED | **Structurally N/A in v1, by design:** markets are house-curated only — there is NO user-created-market path. Admins create/resolve markets via the **separate** admin CRM surface (`current_active_admin`-gated, `backend/app/admin/`); players place bets only via the cookie-gated player `/bets` surface (`backend/app/bets/router.py`, `current_active_player`). The two principal/route boundaries make "bet on a market you created" unreachable. **NOTE (deferral for real-money/v2):** if user-created markets are ever introduced, add an explicit DB-level creator≠bettor constraint — tracked as a v2 item (owner: Pol). |
| 20 | **CORS:** production CORS does not include `*` or dev origins | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | Single explicit origin: `allow_origins=[settings.FRONTEND_BASE_URL]`, `allow_credentials=True` (NOT `*`) — `backend/app/main.py` (CORSMiddleware, Phase 2, Pitfall 7). The dry-run guard (row 32) further fails the build on a hardcoded dev origin leaking into source. |
| 21 | **Secrets:** run `gitleaks`/equivalent; verify `.env.local` is gitignored | `CLOSED BY PHASE 11` | VERIFIED | gitleaks 3-tier (pre-commit `protect --staged` → `backend-ci.yml` PR diff → `security.yml` full-history weekly), already green, negative-tested (`backend/tests/test_gitleaks_blocks_secret.py`, plan 01-04). Phase 11 **adds** `security-scan.yml` (bandit + pip-audit + pnpm-audit + ZAP, plan 11-02). `.env`/`.env.local` gitignored (ephemeral CI `.env` heredoc never committed, never echoed — T-11-01-01). |
| 22 | **Tenant scoping (v1 forward-compat):** every table has `tenant_id` even if always `1` | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | `tenant_id` ghost column on every table from day 1 (PLT-01); single `TENANT_DEFAULT = "…0001"` UUID defined once and reused (`0001_phase1_foundations.py`), carried onto `accounts`/`transfers`/`entries` (0004), `tenant_config` UNIQUE(tenant_id) seam (0009). STATE decisions 2026-05-25 / 01-03 / 10-01. |
| 23 | **Branding:** operator config loaded from data, not hardcoded; logo/palette swap without code change | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | Runtime theming — `tenant_config` single-row table + admin GET/PUT `/admin/tenant-config` + public `GET /branding/current` & `/branding/logo`; server-side hex allowlist `^#[0-9a-fA-F]{6}$`; charts/UI read `var(--brand-primary)` so palette re-skins live (Phase 10, plans 10-01/10-02/10-03, ADD-05/06). No code change to swap logo/palette. |
| 24 | **Observability:** Sentry captures backend AND frontend errors; alert on >X errors/min | `CLOSED BY PHASE 11` | CLOSED (round-trip = Pol manual-verify) | 4 Sentry surfaces tagged `service = api/worker/beat/frontend` (Phase 1, `backend/app/core/sentry.py` + frontend `instrumentation*.ts`). Phase 11 closes the **alert** half: 4 alert-rule definitions (settlement failure, Polymarket spike, reconciliation drift, auth-abuse) — `docs/runbooks/sentry-alerts.md` (plan 11-03). The live event/alert **round-trip needs a real DSN** → Pol manual-verify (see runbook §5 + Task-2 checkpoint). |
| 25 | **Observability:** Postgres metrics exposed (queries, connection count, slow-query log) | `DEFERRED` | DEFERRED | **Owner:** infra. **Reason:** v1 operator-demo observability is Sentry-based (errors + the 4 alert rules); a Prometheus/Postgres-exporter + slow-query stack is not in this repo and out of the demo-gate scope. Documented known gap; PITFALLS "Observability gaps → deployment/infra phase". |
| 26 | **Backups:** backup → drop table → restore → verify integrity (actually do it) | `DEFERRED` | DEFERRED | **Owner:** Pol / infra. **Reason:** no in-repo managed-DB backup harness; backup→drop→restore→verify is an external staging/managed-DB operation (Railway/managed Postgres), not a CI assertion. Surfaced at the Task-2 checkpoint. PITFALLS "Backup not tested → deployment/infra phase". |
| 27 | **Backups:** PITR (point-in-time recovery) tested with WAL archiving | `DEFERRED` | DEFERRED | **Owner:** Pol / infra. **Reason:** same as row 26 — PITR/WAL archiving is a managed-DB infra capability tested outside this repo. Genuinely-external deferral, acknowledged at the Task-2 checkpoint. |
| 28 | **Monitoring:** alert on settlement-task failures, Polymarket error rate, auth-failure spike, balance/ledger drift | `CLOSED BY PHASE 11` | CLOSED (round-trip = Pol manual-verify) | Exactly the 4 alert rules in `docs/runbooks/sentry-alerts.md` (plan 11-03): Rule 1 settlement failure, Rule 2 Polymarket error-rate spike, Rule 3 ledger reconciliation drift, Rule 4 auth-abuse/429 burst — each with an existing in-code emit site. Live firing = Pol round-trip (runbook §5), tracked with row 24. |
| 29 | **Decimal precision:** all API responses serialize Decimal as string, not float | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | Money-as-string (SP-1) throughout via `MoneyStr = Annotated[Decimal, PlainSerializer]` / `field_serializer` — asserted on the raw HTTP wire across wallet, markets, admin, settlement, KPI, realtime (`backend/app/wallet/schemas.py`, `…/markets/schemas.py`, `…/admin/*schemas.py`, `…/settlement/schemas.py`, `…/realtime/publisher.py`). STATE decisions 03-04 / 03-05 / 09-02 / 10-02. |
| 30 | **Timezones:** all DB timestamps are `TIMESTAMPTZ`; frontend renders in user's local TZ | `VERIFIED` | VERIFIED | `DateTime(timezone=True)` (→ `TIMESTAMPTZ`) across models (`backend/app/auth/models.py`, `…/branding/models.py`, wallet/markets/bets); CSV export emits ISO-8601 UTC (`backend/app/admin/csv_export.py`, plan 08-02). Frontend renders in local TZ. |
| 31 | **Regulatory:** ToS forbids transfer/redemption/monetary value; legal review for Spain; geo-block if needed | `CLOSED BY PHASE 11` (scaffold) + `DEFERRED` (counsel) | PARTIAL — scaffold shipped, counsel review DEFERRED | Scaffold shipped (CONTEXT constraint 2): `docs/regulatory.md` + `docs/terms-of-service.md` (placeholder) + `docs/operator-agreement.md` (template stub) (plan 11-04). Transfer/redeem endpoints do not exist (Phase 3 WAL-09 firewall: `RechargeRequest extra=forbid`, no destination field — STATE decision 03-04; PITFALLS #3 negative test). **DEFERRED:** the actual **Spanish-counsel ToS/token review** — **owner:** external Spanish legal counsel; **reason:** gating external dependency per STATE Blockers ("not deferrable; gating dependency on Phase 11 completion") — surfaced at the Task-2 checkpoint. |
| 32 | **Demo-trap check:** prod-migration dry run — change every env/secret/hostname/DB conn → nothing breaks; catches hardcoded dev URLs | `CLOSED BY PHASE 11` | VERIFIED | `.github/workflows/prod-migration-dry-run.yml` (plan 11-01): boots the full compose stack under a staging-style `.env` (`ENVIRONMENT=staging`, throwaway secrets), `alembic upgrade head` (single head 0009), reuses the Phase-5 `tests/integration/test_phase5_e2e.py` bet→settle E2E under `ENVIRONMENT=staging`, then `bin/check_no_dev_config.sh` **fails the build** on hardcoded `ENVIRONMENT=dev` / bare `localhost`/`127.0.0.1` in `backend/app`+`frontend/src`. Ephemeral `.env` never committed/echoed. |

## Summary of dispositions

| Disposition | Count | Rows |
|-------------|-------|------|
| `VERIFIED` (base invariant, evidence cited) | 17 | 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 29, 30 *(13 counted as VERIFIED-only; 13 also overlaps Phase 11)* |
| `CLOSED BY PHASE 11` (workstream-closed) | 6 | 13†, 21, 24, 28, 31‡, 32 |
| `VERIFY-ONLY (Pol track)` — wallet/ledger/concurrency, NOT re-implemented | 6 | 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 *(+ row 4: Pol's `DEF-03-01` isolation debt now RESOLVED, `f8a8859`)* |
| `DEFERRED` (reason + owner, external) | 4 | 25 (infra — Postgres metrics), 26 (Pol/infra — backup restore), 27 (Pol/infra — PITR), 31‡ (counsel — ToS review) |

> Counts overlap because a few rows carry two tokens (e.g. row 13 is both `VERIFIED` and Phase-11-`CLOSED`;
> row 31 is `CLOSED` for the scaffold + `DEFERRED` for the counsel review). What matters for the gate:
> **all 32 items have a non-blank Result + Evidence**, the **wallet/ledger/concurrency rows are
> verify-only against existing tests + Pol's separate track (none re-implemented)**, and **every
> Phase-11 workstream (dry-run 11-01, security-scan 11-02, Sentry runbook 11-03, regulatory scaffold
> 11-04) is cited as closing evidence.**
> † Row 13 (login rate-limit) is a pre-existing `VERIFIED` invariant that Phase 11 *additionally* wraps
> with Sentry Rule 4. ‡ Row 31 is split scaffold-`CLOSED` / counsel-`DEFERRED`.

### Genuinely-external deferrals requiring Pol's sign-off (Task 2)

1. **Backup → drop → restore → verify (row 26) + PITR/WAL (row 27)** — no in-repo backup harness;
   managed-DB/staging infra operation. Owner: Pol / infra.
2. **Sentry alert round-trip (rows 24 + 28)** — alert-rule definitions shipped (`docs/runbooks/sentry-alerts.md`);
   live firing needs the real `xpredict-staging` DSN. Owner of the round-trip: Pol (runbook §5).
3. **Spanish-counsel ToS/token review (row 31)** — external legal dependency; gating per STATE Blockers.
   Owner: external Spanish counsel.
4. **Postgres metrics / slow-query stack (row 25)** — out of v1 demo-gate scope (observability is
   Sentry-based). Owner: infra.

## Verification (this audit)

- `docs/LOOKS-DONE-CHECKLIST.md` exists, ≥ 50 lines, **32 audit rows** (one per PITFALLS item).
- Cites `prod-migration-dry-run` (row 32), `security-scan` (rows 21, 11–14), and the Sentry alert
  runbook (`docs/runbooks/sentry-alerts.md`, rows 24/28) as closing evidence.
- Every wallet/ledger/concurrency row (1, 2, 4, 5, 6) is `VERIFY-ONLY (Pol track)`, references existing
  tests/migrations, and is explicitly **not** re-implemented (row 4 names Pol's `DEF-03-01`).
- `git diff --stat` for plan 11-06 → **docs-only** (`docs/LOOKS-DONE-CHECKLIST.md` only; no source/test edit).
- **Phase gate:** the Task-2 human checkpoint records Pol's sign-off on this audit + its 4 deferrals.
